          We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore
          where the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus our
          process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
          design more efficient?”

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you
          what can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical parts
          of the design.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Report</h3>
        <p>
          We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and
          provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks.
          This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
        </p>
        <h3>Ways to Redesign</h3>
        <p>
          We provide several strategies for further redesign by various
          contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you
          with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and
          quick but effective improvements.
