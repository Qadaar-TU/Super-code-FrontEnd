      <h1>I have a dark side, too.</h1>
      <p>
        I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted
        until the dark became my world and I could see. God created pudding, and
        then he rested. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a
        compliment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm partial to air conditioning. I will not kill my sister. I will not
        kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I'm not the monster he wants
        me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely.
        <strong> With my own set of rules.</strong> <em> I'm Dexter.</em> Boo.

      <h1>Across from where?</h1>
      <p>
        Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Whoa, this guy's straight? I care deeply
        for nature. Steve Holt! It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hear the jury's still out on science. <strong> Steve Holt!</strong>
        <em> Guy's a pro.</em> He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want
        this thing smelling like fish.
